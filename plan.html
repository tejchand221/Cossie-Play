<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The primary objective of this website is to provide online presence to our business through website and social media. We can spread awareness about our brand and provide support to our customer by handling their grievance and queries, which ultimately leads to sales, customer acquisition & satisfaction. </p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> We set up goals in Google Analytics to trace a user’s actions from A to B. They can click on a social media share button, sign up for an email list, buy a product, purchase cossies or make a order, or make a delivery. It’s just a case of using the right tools.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>A target market is anyone who might be interested in our products or services. Our target audience is the group of people of the groups, for example—to whom you direct a specific marketing asset or advertise. </p>
